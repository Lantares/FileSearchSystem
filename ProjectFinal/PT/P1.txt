The wolf and the sheep 

A wolf had been badly wounded by dogs. He lay sick and maimed in his lair. 

He felt very hungry and thirsty. When a sheep passed by, he asked him to fetch some water from the stream. 

"If you bring me the water," he said, "I will find means to get some food." 

"Yes," said the sheep, "if I bring you the water, you would undoubtedly make me your food."
